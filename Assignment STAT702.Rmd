#1 Analysis of Sales Data

##(a) For the product (sku_id) which has been assigned to your group (see page 6), compute the total monthly sales from January 2011 – September 2013. Present your results in an appropriate plot and write 2 – 3 sentences describing your results.

Hint: This will require some “wrangling” of the variable week. To do this, format week as a date and then use the appropriate lubridate function to extract the month.

Marking Criteria

 *  Total monthly sales have been correctly computed and are displayed in an appropriate plot.
 
 *  Description of results/plot is correct and provides useful insights.
 
 *  Plot is constructed using ggplot2 and has appropriate titles, labels, scales etc.
